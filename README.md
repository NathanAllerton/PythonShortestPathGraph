# Shortest Path Graph in Python

Makes use of NetworkX library and PyLab.

This creates a fixed graph and determines the shortest path determined by all of the node and edges.

We were tasked to do this in any programming language we wanted, which I believe was half of the battle in this assignment. I orignially wanted to do this using JavaFX since I had a lot of experience in it. I ended up however choosing Python instead, since I thought it would be good practice and I was able to keep the code much more cleaner than if I had used Java. I had very little experience in Python at the time, and this made me understand how powerful Python is.

This was fun. It was a challenge to fine tune the program and reduce it to as few lines as possible, while keeping the program fast, but I did it.
